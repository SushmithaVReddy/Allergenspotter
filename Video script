Our Hackathon project is called Allergen Spotter. 
Do you or someone you know have food allergies? Do you find yourself checking food labels and ingredients lists all the time? 
Allergen Spotter can help with that. It's web-based application for spotting allergies on food labels.  

For Hackathon, our goal was to get a working proof of concept for this app using public APIs and Azure's Computer Vision.

Checkout this demo to see how it works. 

First select your allergies from the list, for now you can select upto 5 allergies. 

Next, give the app access to your camera. Bring your food label into the frame and hit **Capture!**. If you're happy with the image quality, click **Check for allergies**.

Let the app do its thing and...

If any of your selected allergies are spotted, they'll show up in this section here.
