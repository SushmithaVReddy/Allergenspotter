Our Hackathon project is called Allergen Spotter. 
Do you or someone you love have food allergies? Do you find yourself checking food labels and ingredients lists all the time? Allergen Spotter can help with that. 
It's a web-based application for spotting allergies on food labels.  

Checkout this demo to see how it works. 

First create a profile and select your allergies from the list. 
Please note that by creating a profile you are opting to allow this information to be saved in our database. 
If you prefer not to create a profile, you can also use the application as a guest. 

Next, while in the app take a picture of the food label or ingredients list with your camera. 

Click this button and TA DA!

If any of your selected allergies are spotted, Allergen Spotter will let you know.
